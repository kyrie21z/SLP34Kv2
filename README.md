In this work, we first built a large dataset called SLP34K. The dataset was collected based on a real-world waterway intelligent traffic surveillance system. Images in the datasets were captured by eight surveillance cameras located at eight different locations over 42 months. Finally, by using more cameras located at more different locations and long-period capturing, we have obtained a dataset of 34,385 SLP images of high diversity.

We also propose a simple yet effective SLP recognition baseline method, with a strong visual encoder. The strong visual encoder is achieved by two strategies. First, we employ self-supervised learning, to pre-train the visual encoder, which enables the encoder to learn robust visual representations without labeled data. Second, we refine the encoder via a semantic enhancement module, which finetunes the encoder via a contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the semantic consistency between the SLP image and its corresponding text label.

# 1. Runtime environment

![.](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9-yellow) ![.](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pytorch-1.12.1-yellow)  

## 1.1 Code acquisition

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/SLP34K.git
```
We use Anaconda as a virtual environment setup tool for model training. Next, we will introduce the training environment setup steps for self-supervised pretraining and SLP recognition fine-tuning, as well as the required installation configuration files. Due to conflicts between certain software package versions, our pre-training and fine-tuning were completed in two different virtual environments.

## 1.2 Self-supervised pre-training environment
```shell

cd SLP34K/mae
conda create -n slk34k_mae python=3.8
conda activate slk34k_mae
pip install torch==1.8.1+cu111 torchvision==0.9.1+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Attention please**: Please note that our pre-training code requires the installation of timm software version 0.3.2 (timm==0.3.2). Therefore, if your PyTorch version is higher than 1.8.1, you may need to make some corresponding code modifications. For more details, please refer to this [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/issues/420#issuecomment-776459842).

## 1.3 SLP recognition fine-tuning environment

```shell
cd SLP34K/ocr_training
conda create --name slk34k_rec python=3.9
conda activate slk34k_rec
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116

# 3. Model training

Our baseline method was trained and evaluated on both the SLP34K dataset and the publicly available text recognition dataset Union14M. Next, we will describe how the model was trained and tested on these two datasets.

## 3.2 SLP/Text recognition fine-tuning

After the completion of the first stage of pre-training, we enter the second stage of fine-tuning training for SLP recognition. Please follow the codes below to complete the fine-tuning training.

### Training on SLP34K (for SLP recognition)

```


## 3.3 Evaluation

After the model training is completed, we can proceed with the performance evaluation of the model. Next, we will provide test scripts for evaluating the performance on different datasets.

### Evaluation on SLP34K

```shell
cd ./ocr_training

./test.py outputs/ship/maevit_infonce_plm/checkpoints/last.ckpt --batch_size 700
--test_data SLP34K --test_dir SLP34K_lmdb_benchmark


```

### Evaluation on Union14M

```shell
cd ./ocr_training

./test.py outputs/union14m/maevit_infonce_plm/checkpoints/last.ckpt --batch_size 700 \
--test_data TEST_UNION14M --test_dir Union14m_benchmark

```


### Evaluation on six common benchmarks

```shell
cd ./ocr_training

```

# 4. Local online testing with Gradio

We provide a local SLP recognition performance testing script based on Gradio. With the dataset we provide and the model provided by us or trained by yourself, you can test the SLP recognition performance locally.
```shell
cd ./ocr_training

python gradio_SLP34K.py

```
